# GROUP 16 - Project Dolos

## Team Info - We are team 16
* Hood Phill
* Horak Chris 
* Pham Duy
* Rakhlei Dimitri 
* Trepanier-Bracken Tyler

## Project Overview
* Create a simple and fun game that is easy to learn but hard to master.
* It was to do this by being bright and colourful, simple and easy to read, but have enough depth to entertain players.
* Use our technical coding abilities, art skills, and first-hand gaming experience to create a game that we would want to play.


## Technologies
* Phaser Game Framework
* Javascript, JQuerry, Ajax
* Backend: PHP with MySQL
* Photoshop for art assets
* Intel XDK for testing
* Sublime Text, Notepad++


## Code Structure
* asset (This folder store all music and picture files)
* login (All login backend files over here)
  - index.php (Checking on login information)
  - login.php (Perform the login)
  - login.html (Login UI)
* css   (This folder store our css style)
* lib   (This folder store Phaser Framework library)
* src   (Our main code)
  - main.js       (This is the main referecens file. 
                      It stores a reference of all other js files in this folder)
  - Boot.js       (Load boot screen)
  - Preload.js    (Load all images and sounds)
  - MainMenu.js   (Load main menu screen)
  - LeaderBoard.js (Load leader board screen)
  - LevelSelect.js (Load level select screen)
  - Game.js       (Our main game engine ove)here.
  - WinScreen.js  (Load level finish screen)
  - Generator.js  (We haven't use this file yet)
  - Main Pseudo-Code.js (We haven't use this file yet)
* index.html (Our main html code)
* sql.php (Basic backend code)
* test.php (Basic backend code)

> index.html imports JQuerry library from Google Hosted Library and Phaser Framework library from lib folder.

> It also imports all game's engine files from src folder.

> sql.php and test.php need mysql on our server in order to work properly.

## Issues
* We allocated enough time to satisfy the requirements but didnâ€™t have time to create everything we thought of.
* It took half of the development cycle to properly implement the grid
* After that, the coding was smooth sailing, easy flying, and we chugged along just fine.
